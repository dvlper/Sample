Summary:Extensively involved in design and analysis phase of the projects and proposed various changes.Developed customMapReduce, Spark programs, PigLatin Scripts and Hive Queries.Developed several pig and hive UDFs to meet the business requirements.Used Spark, Kafka, and Storm along with other open source projects to create a real-time analytics framework to get the data from various sources and dump it into Hadoop lake. Analyzed business requirements and cross-verified them with expected business functionality.Handled importing of data from various data sources, performed transformations using Hive, MapReduce and Pig and thereafter loaded data into HDFS and extracted the data from Oracle into HDFS using Sqoop.Used Maven and Jenkins for continuous build integration and deployment.Created and maintained technical documentation for launching the Hadoop jobs and for executing Hive queries and Pig Scripts.Created an E-mail notification service upon completion of job for the particular team which requested for the data.Involved in writing shell scripts in scheduling and automation of tasks.Used Spark Streaming to collect the data from Kafka in near-real-time and performs necessary transformations and aggregation on the fly to build and persist the data in NoSQL store (Hbase).Used Pig in three distinct workloads like pipelines, iterative processing and research.Involved in transforming data from legacy tables to HDFS, and HBASE tables using Sqoop.Implemented test scripts to support test driven development and continuous integration.Exported the analyzed data to the relational databases using Sqoop for visualization and to generate reports for the BI team.Worked closely with Analytics team in generating the reports and designing ETL workflows for Tableau and Platfora and provided the feasibility of using Hbase tables to connect to tableau server by performing Hive-Hbase integration.
