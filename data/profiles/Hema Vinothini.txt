Summary:Hi all!!! Am very much passionate about the work which am doing!!! Want to learn many things in my life... I will dowhat I wanna do... Satisfaction is the first ever thing needed in my life. I have started my career as a HR trainee, in a small consultancy. This work taught me the roles, responsibilities of HR. What are their works, how vital role they are playing in a company? Later I have joined as Research Associate in Kompsos Media Pvt Ltd. It is an e-learning based company, where we did projects for colleges and schools. Since it is a project regarding education, the way of working is different and quite interesting. I enjoyed working there. I am friendly in nature and I can able to focus the things in an ease manner. These qualities drives me to manage a team in a short period, which is my another achievement. Now getting into different career!! Experiencing the new environment and the new world as IT Recruiter......!! Very excited about this new start-up since getting introduced to new peoples and maintaining professional relationship with them!!!
