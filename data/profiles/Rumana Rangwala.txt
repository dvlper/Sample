Summary:I am an ardent people's person and spent several years in Banking, but a few years ago someone inspired me to getinto Recruiting and I have truly enjoyed it. My profession has given me an opportunity to make a positive impact on the lives of those I work with, be it the hiring managers or the awesome talented job seekers.I have successfully recruited for diverse technical and functional positions that include Developers, Architects, Business Analysts, Quality Assurance Analysts and Project Managers. Whether it is a simple role or a hard to find skills set, I strive to find the best candidate that have the required talent and are a perfect cultural fit too. While I constantly want to see our clients happy it is equally important for me to provide the job satisfaction for my candidates and maintain a strong relationship with them as well.
